# Hello Test-Driven Development

## Why TDD?

1. You know when you are finished, without having to worry about a long bug trail.
2. It lets your teammates count on you, and you on them.

## Rules

1. Write new code only if an automated test has failed.
2. Eliminate duplication.

## Steps

The 2 rules imply an order of steps:
1. Red: at first, write a test that does nto work, and even does not compile.
2. Green: write the simplest code that makes the test pass.
3. Refactor: eliminate duplication.

Red/Green/Refactor is the TDD mantra.
